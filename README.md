### üìÑ Documentation:

Documentation files can be generated using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).  

To install Doxygen on Linux, please type: `sudo apt-get install doxygen`.  
If you prefere a Graphical User Interface (GUI): `sudo apt-get install doxygen-gui`.  \[‚Üê \**suggested*\*\]  

If you have doxygen installed on your system, you can generate the documentation files using these commands:  

1. Open the Doxygen GUI interface by using this terminal command: `doxywizard`  
2. A window should open, **click on** "**File**" **>** "**Open**" and **select the file named** "*Doxyfile*" (in the "*doc*" folder).  
3. At this point some fileds in the GUI should have been automatically filled, **go to the** "**Run**" **tab**, and **press on** "**Run doxygen**"  
4. When the program completes, **click on** "**Show HTML output**" to consult the documentation.  
5. At this point you can close the Doxygen GUI.  

Note: To open the documentation at any time, just search for the folder "*html*" into the "*doc*" folder and open the file named "**index.html**".  

Note: For any other question, please refer to the Doxygen official website at this link: https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html.

<a name="usage"></a>
### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Usage:

Note: :warning: The code is intended to be **executed on a Linux system** only (it has been tested under **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**).  

Every folder is equipped with two files that simplify the compilation of the code:
* "*COMPILE.sh*"  (it is a script that contains some simple lines of code used to start the compilation process)  
* "*CMakeLists.txt*"  (it contains a set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets)  

<a name="easy-compilation"></a>
**üî§ Easy compilation and execution:**  
To **compile and run** each example open the terminal in the folder containing the "*COMPILE.sh*" file and execute it using the following command:  
```
./COMPILE.sh
```  

**Note:** Before executing the "*COMPILE.sh*" script, try to make it executable using the following command: $`chmod +x COMPILE.sh`  

**Note:** The default deal.II path used in the script is the one that makes use of the PoliMi mkModules (see the [Installation](#installation) section). If you use a standard version of deal.II or have a custom installation, please modify the PATH contained in the "*COMPILE.sh*" at the tag "DDEAL_II_DIR" before running it.  



<br/>  

<a name="poisson"></a>
### :triangular_flag_on_post: Poisson example:

**Note:** **Follow these instructions also for all the other examples** (excluding the \"*Elastic membrane*\" example). In these cases please substitute in the following the \"*poisson*\" keyword with the name of the main source file (for example use \"*step-8*\" instead).  

The code of the **Poisson example** consist of a single file:
* "poisson.cc"  

Note: This code is strongly based on the deal.II library example "[step-4](https://www.dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/step_4.html)".  

<img src="./examples/01-Poisson/doc/IMG_step-4_IGA_t5.png" alt="FIGURE: Poisson example result" width="480" height="480">  

**Img. 1**: Result plot of the *poisson* code.  

#### üëâ Instructions to **compile** the code:

```
cd poisson
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DDEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/dealii/installation
make
```
NOTE: The default installation folder of deal.II library should be: `/usr/include/deal.II/`

If everything went well, you should have an executable named `poisson` in the new *build* directory.  

Note: At this point, if you want to recompile the code after some changes to the source code, 
it is sufficient to go to the *build* directory and use the command $`make`.


#### üëâ Instructions to **execute** the code:

The executable takes 0 or 5 arguments to run, respectively:
```
./poisson
```
or
```
./poisson  FE_TYPE  QUADRATURE  DEG  CYCLE_START  CYCLE_STOP
```
The accepted arguments are:

* FE_TYPE:
 	* `bernstein`  [default]
 	* `lagrange`
 	* `lobatto`
* QUADRATURE:
 	* `legendre`   [default]
 	* `lobatto`
* DEG:         (es: ` 1 `) degree of the finite element space
* CYCLE_START: (es: ` 0 `) initial refinement of the grid
* CYCLE_STOP:  (es: ` 5 `) final refinement of the grid  

Example: ` ./poisson bernstein legendre 1 0 5 `


<br/>  

<a name="obstacle"></a>
### :triangular_flag_on_post: Elastic membrane example:

The code of the **Elastic membrane example**, previously called \"**obstacle**\", consist of a series of files incuded in two folders:
* "source" directory
* "include" directory

Note: This code is based on the deal.II library example "[step-41](https://www.dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/step_41.html)".  

<img src="./examples/05-Elastic_membrane/doc/IMG_step-41_IGA_t6.png" alt="FIGURE: Obstacle example result" width="480" height="480">  

**Img. 2**: Result plot of the *obstacle* code.  

#### üëâ Instructions to **compile** the code:

```
cd obstacle
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DDEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/dealii/installation
make
```
NOTE: The default installation folder of deal.II library should be: `/usr/include/deal.II/`

If everything went well, you should have an executable named `exe` in the new *build* directory. 

Note: At this point, if you want to recompile the code after some changes to the source code, 
it is sufficient to go to the *build* directory and use the command $`make`.


#### üëâ Instructions to **execute** the code:

The executable takes no arguments. To run, go to the "build" folder, and use the following command:
```
./exe
```

<a name="installation"></a>
### üõ†Ô∏è Installation:

Note: The codes have been tested under a clean installation of Xubuntu, version **20.04 LTS**.  
Note: The codes have been tested using the **deal.II version 9.2.0** (and *9.1.1-9 build2*).  
Note: The orignal code required **deal.II version 8.3** to work properly, in the code you can find some suggestions in order to make the actual code compilable with that version but remember it is not tested, so please consider upgrading to version 9.2.0.  


In order to setup the environment, follow the following steps:  

<br/>  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è \[A\] Easy installation procedure (using the Linux Advanced Packaging Tool):

1. Install a C++ compiler:  
   $ `gcc -v`                     check the installed version of gcc (9.3.0)  
   $ `clang -v`                   check the installed version of clang (10.0.0)  
   $ `sudo apt install gcc`       install the last version of gcc  
   $ `sudo apt install clang`     install the last version of clang  

2. Update all packages before start the deal.II installation procedure:  
   $ `sudo apt-get update`  

3. Install the deal.II library:  
   $ `sudo apt-get install libdeal.ii-dev`  
  Note: This command will install the main deal.II library, along with all its suggested additional packages:   
  (es: *boost, fftw3, superlu, trilinos, open mpi, muparser, occt, ...* )  
  The required space is about ~ 2 GB for all.  

**Unistall the library:**
1. Unistall the main library:  
   $ `sudo apt-get --purge remove libdeal.ii-dev`
   
2. Remove automatically installed packages which are no longer required:  
   $ `sudo apt-get autoremove`

3. \[*usually NOT needed*\] If you need to manually remove directories or files, plese use:   
   $ `sudo rm FILENAME`           manually remove a file  
   $ `sudo rm -r ./FOLDERNAME`    manually remove a folder and all its content  

<br/>  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è \[B\] PoliMi installation procedure (using a shared mk-modules archive) :  
Note: This installation procedure is suggested for [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/) staff members and students.

1. Download the archive containing the library and a lot of other tools used by the PoliMi [MOX](https://mox.polimi.it/) Lab:  
   https://github.com/elauksap/mk/releases/download/v2020.1/mk-2020.1-lifex.tar.gz
   
2. Extract the archive with the command:  
   $ `sudo tar xvzf mk-2020.1-lifex.tar.gz -C /`
   
3. In order to load all modules on each time a terminal is open, add the following two lines at the end of the system file "*~/.bashrc*":  
   `source /u/sw/etc/profile`  
   `module load gcc-glibc/9 dealii`  
   Note: Reboot the terminal (close and open again the terminal window) in order to activate the updates.   

**Unistall the library:**
1. Remove the two added lines from the "*~/.bashrc*" file;  
   This should be enough to disable all modules from loading, leaving the system as if no modules were installed.  
   
2. Remove all modules, using the command:  
   $ `module purge`  

<br/>  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è \[C\] Manual installation procedure (downloading and compiling the library source code):  
1. Go to the deal.II official website at https://www.dealii.org/download.html and download the most recent archive;  
   Note: The most recent tested version is the "*dealii-9.2.0.tar.gz*".  
2. Decompress the archive into a folder like "*/home/USERNAME/dealII/*"
3. Create a new folder "build" inside the extracted folder (es: "*/home/USERNAME/dealII/dealii-9.2.0/build*")
4. Now use the following command to install the library, and wait until you see the "*Configuring done*" message.  
   $ `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/ ..`
5. Compile the library by doing:  
   $ `sudo make (sudo make --jobs=# install)`  
   Note: Change the "\#" character with the number of cores of your system. If you don't know use  $ `sudo make (sudo make --jobs=2 install)`.  
   And then run:  
   $ `sudo make install`  
6. The installation should be ended. Try to run the "*step-1*":  
   $ `cmake .`, `make`, `./step-1`

<a name="output"></a>
### ‚ÜòÔ∏è Code output:

The main outputs are usually easy-to-consult text files reporting the convergence table and other execution data.  

The **output image files** are saved in **.vtk** format.  
The *Visualization Toolkit* (*VTK*) is an open-source software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing and scientific visualization.  

In order to open *.vtk* or *.vtu* files you can use a graphical software like "**ParaView**" or "**VisIt**".  

<br/>  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and usage of ParaView on Unix systems:  
1. Use the following command to install the program (using the Linux Advanced Packaging Tool):  
    $ `sudo apt install paraview`  

üëâ Steps to correctly see the .vtk image files with **ParaView** (*for beginners*):  
1. Open "*ParaView Client*" from the applications menu;  
2. Click on "File" > "Open" > Select the directory > Select the \*.vtk Group;  
3. Make the plot 3D: "Filters" > "Search" > "Warp By Scalar";  
4. Note: Always click on the "Apply" button to view any changes;  

<br/>  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and usage of VisIt on Unix systems:  
1. Go to the project website: https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/executables;
2. Download the archive for your system (es: *Linux - x86_64 64 bit Ubuntu 20*) and download also the "*VisIt install script*";
3. Make the install script executable (es: $ `chmod 755 visit-install3_1_4`);
4. Use the following command to install the program:  
    $ `sudo [script_name] [visit version] [system in use] [installation path]`  
    Example:  $ `sudo visit-install3_1_4 3.1.4 linux-x86_64-ubuntu20 /usr/local/bin/visit`  
5. During the installation, if asked, select the remote-computing center nearest to your location and press *enter* until the installation has finished. (es: ETH Zurich in Europe)

üëâ Steps to correctly see the .vtk image files with **VisIt** (*for beginners*):  
1. Open VisIt: `/usr/local/bin/visit/bin/visit`;
2. Click on "Open" > Select the directory > Select the \*.vtk database;
3. Now press on "Add" > "Pseudocolor" > "Active set";  
    Note: it is also possible to add features like "Contour" or "Mesh".
4. Make the plot 3D: "Operators" > "Transform" > "Elevate";
5. Click on "**Draw**" and you should see a 3D movable picture in the active window.
